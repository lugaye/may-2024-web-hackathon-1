        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am Joshua Abu Mansaray, an 18-year-old economics student at the University of Sierra Leone. Alongside my studies in economics, I am also pursuing software engineering with PLP. Driven by an insatiable curiosity, I love exploring new knowledge and skills.</p>
        <p>As a Christian, I am passionate about God and people, believing that human potential is the greatest resource. This belief fuels my commitment to volunteering and tutoring pupils at home for free, helping them to achieve their academic goals.</p>
