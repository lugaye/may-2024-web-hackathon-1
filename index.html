            <h3>The Tinker Project - Water Level Monitor</h3>
            <p>The aim of this project is to provide a water level monitor system.
                The system works in this manner: the water or fluid is pumped into a tank and the distance sensor detects the distance of the water from the sensor thereby detecting the water level.
                When the owner sees the level of the water, he has the access to the click of a remote button which in turn shuts down the circuit breaker of the water pump; hence stopping the process of water pumping completely.
