         <h2>Ah! Nala, Ndokose, Mpembe, Nongquma, Nojakadelana, Sikhanya'nkungwini, Nzima'Ngwenya. Camagu!</h2>
         
        <p>I don't really know exactly where the Nalas originated. However I am sure that they can be found all over South Africa and there are also roumours that they can also be found in Zimbabwe.
            These people to me they appear as people who really like to explore different places of the world, actually you could say they are free spirited people.
            As a matter of fact I have experienced this first hand because I am one of them. 
            My great grandfather was born and bred in a small village called Impukane, in Nciba a place situated near the Kei River not far away from East London in the
            Eastern Cape. Our mother tongue is Xhosa, we come in different shades of Black but mostly we are light skinned people.
