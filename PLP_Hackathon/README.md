## PLP WEB HACKATHON

PLP_Hackathon directory, contain my website portfolio, and three subdirectories of my projects made with both 
HTML and CSS.

The first project is a login page, in this page I have created the crucial part of a website or app that allows users to access restricted content by entering their username and password or by authenticating through social media. 

The second project is a landing page, about recommandation of shoes.

The third project is also a landing page for a website that will give you a little history about the origin of a specific clan name.

I have done all these project with a goal of improving my HTML and CSS skills, creating them have really made my journey of learning these programming languages very straight forward and smooth.
