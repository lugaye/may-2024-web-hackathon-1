                <h1>Best Recommendation You can ever Get!</h1>
                <p>In this website my goal is to give you my take on certain shoes I have bought for myself.
                   Why shoes? You might be wondering, to me shoes are very important because my feet are very
                   sensitive, they get injured very easy, so having shoes means I won't have to walk bare-foot on
                the soil, that is sometimes very hot, or with a lot sharp stones. <br>
                <hr>
            Here is some disclaimer before we delve in so deep: I am not sponsered by any of the shoe brands that I will
        be bragging about in this page. 
                <hr>
